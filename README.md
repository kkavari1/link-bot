- Project Page: https://glitch.com/~continuous-airport
- Bot page: https://developer.webex.com/my-apps/eplus-link-bot
- Built using: https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/botkit-template

- Still considered a work in progress.. To Do:
  - Create an exportable .html file for quickly adding all the links to user's browser bookmarks
  - Create a command that will allow users of the bot to suggest new commands and links to be added to the bot
  - Further testing & catch exceptions 
  - You tell me! :)
